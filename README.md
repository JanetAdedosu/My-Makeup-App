My Makeup App

In this repository, I will use build a full stack To Do app using React and Node/Express

OBJECTIVES

1 Create a backend
2 Connect to the external API 
3 Create a front end.
Setup

DEPENDENCIES

Run npm install in the project folder to install dependencies related to Express (the server).

cd client and run npm install install dependencies related to React (the client).

For the External API ,use this https://makeup-api.herokuapp.com/

SUGGESTION
Implement or link the external API to the home page where the key "Enter Product" is ,instead of it displaying 
products submitted,it should display products from the external API.

Run Your Development Servers

Run npm start in project directory to start the Express server on port 4000
cd client and run npm run dev to start client server in development mode with hot reloading in port 5174.
Client is configured so all API calls will be proxied to port 4000 for a smoother development experience. Yay!
You can test your client app in http://localhost:5174
